<p>
    I am Kailash Prasad, a Prime Minister Research Fellow at the <a href="https://iitgn.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar</a>.
    I completed my B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Arunachal Pradesh in 2018, and I was awarded
    Chairman and Institute Gold Medal for outstanding academic performance. Currently, I am pursuing Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the nanoDC Lab,
    IIT Gandhinagar, under the guidance of <a href="https://joycee.people.iitgn.ac.in/">Prof. Joycee Mekie</a>.
</p>

<p>
    My research focuses on hardware for machine learning, in-memory computing,
    approximate computing, CAD tool design, and SRAM memory subsystem design.
    I am an SRC Research Scholar and the recipient of the Intel India Research Fellowship in 2020.
    My work has been accepted and recognized in premier EDA conferences such as ASP-DAC and DATE,
    with some papers receiving Best Paper Nominations.
    I also serve as a reviewer for various conferences, including ISCAS, AICAS,
    and journals such as IEEE TCAS I and TCAS II.
</p>

<p>
    I expertise in RTL to GDS flow for digital IC design, and I have had the opportunity
    to lead a team of 15 people for two tapeouts in UMC 65nm in 2020 and 2022.
    Additionally, I expertise in SRAM memory subsystem design for digital and analog
    in-memory computing and physical unclonable function.
</p>

<p>
    I am passionate about designing circuits, teaching microelectronics and VLSI,
    and building an army of VLSI engineers.
    During my tenure of Ph.D, I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to build
    and lead teams, which has been an enriching experience.
</p>

<p>
    My belief in the importance of perseverance and determination can be summarized
    with this quote:
    <blockquote>
        "Overcoming barriers may require us to take different paths - sometimes we cross over,
        sometimes we tunnel through, and sometimes we break them down altogether.
        But with determination and a willingness to explore new avenues, we can always reach our destination."
        - KP
