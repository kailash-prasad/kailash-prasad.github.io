I am Kailash Prasad, a Prime Minister Research Fellow at the [Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar](https://iitgn.ac.in/). I completed my B.Tech. in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the National Institute of Technology Arunachal Pradesh in 2018, and I was awarded Chairman and Institute Gold Medal for outstanding academic performance. Currently, I am pursuing Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at the nanoDC Lab, IIT Gandhinagar, under the guidance of [Prof. Joycee Mekie](https://joycee.people.iitgn.ac.in/).

My research focuses on hardware for machine learning, in-memory computing, approximate computing, CAD tool design, and SRAM memory subsystem design. I am an SRC Research Scholar and the recipient of the Intel India Research Fellowship in 2020. My work has been accepted and recognized in premier EDA conferences such as ASP-DAC and DATE, with some papers receiving Best Paper Nominations. I also serve as a reviewer for various conferences, including ISCAS, AICAS, and journals such as IEEE TCAS I and TCAS II.

I expertise in RTL to GDS flow for digital IC design, and I have had the opportunity to lead a team of 15 people for two tapeouts in UMC 65nm in 2020 and 2022. Additionally I expertise in SRAM memory subsystem design for digital and analog in-memory computing and physical unclonable function.

I am passionate about designing circuits, teaching microelectronics and VLSI, and building army of VLSI engineers. During my tenure of Ph.D, I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to build and lead teams, which has been an enriching experience. 

My belief in the importance of perseverance and determination can be summarized with this quote: 

"Overcoming barriers may require us to take different paths - sometimes we cross over, sometimes we tunnel through, and sometimes we break them down altogether. But with determination and a willingness to explore new avenues, we can always reach our destination." - KP
